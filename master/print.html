<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-fuel"><a class="header" href="#what-is-fuel">What is Fuel?</a></h1>
<p>Fuel v1 began as a layer-2 (L2) scalability technology for a monolithic Ethereum. It was the first optimistic rollup on mainnet Ethereum, deployed at the end of 2020.</p>
<p>Today, Fuel is the fastest modular execution layer. Fuel delivers the highest security and flexible throughput, with a focus on a superior developer experience.</p>
<p>Here’s how we do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parallel transaction execution</li>
<li>Fuel Virtual Machine (FuelVM)</li>
<li><a href="./fuel-toolchain.html">Developer tooling with Sway Language and Forc</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="parallel-transaction-execution"><a class="header" href="#parallel-transaction-execution">Parallel Transaction Execution</a></h2>
<p>Fuel delivers unmatched processing capacity through its ability to execute transactions in parallel by using strict state access lists in the form of a UTXO model. This enables Fuel to use far more threads and cores of your CPU that are typically idle in single-threaded blockchains. As a result, Fuel can deliver far more compute, state accesses, and transactional throughput than its single-threaded counterparts.</p>
<p>With the EVM, it is difficult to know if, and where there are dependencies between transactions, so you are forced to execute transactions sequentially.</p>
<p>The FuelVM uses the UTXO model, enabling parallel transaction execution by identifying transaction dependencies through what is known as state access lists. With the FuelVM, Fuel full nodes identify the accounts that a transaction touches, mapping out dependencies before execution.</p>
<h2 id="fuelvm"><a class="header" href="#fuelvm">FuelVM</a></h2>
<p>The FuelVM learns from the Ethereum ecosystem, implementing improvements that were suggested to the Ethereum VM (EVM) for many years but couldn’t be implemented due to the need to maintain backward compatibility.</p>
<p>Here are some EIP that have been implemented in the FuelVM:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>EIP</th><th>Description</th><th>Implementation</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/648">Easy Parallelizability</a></td><td>Allow transactions in the EVM to be processed in parallel by specifying what addresses they can access.</td><td>Fuel can execute transactions in parallel by using strict state access lists with our UTXO model. This allows Fuel to use of all the threads and cores of your CPU to validate transactions.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2098">EIP-2098: Compact Signature Representation</a></td><td>Reduce signatures from 65 bytes to 64 bytes to simplify handling transactions in client code, reduce gas costs, and reduce transaction sizes.</td><td>Fuel compresses signature data by a byte, from 65 to 64 bytes.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074">EIP-3074: <code>AUTH</code> and <code>AUTHCALL</code> opcodes</a></td><td>Introduces two EVM instructions, <code>AUTH</code> and <code>AUTHCALL</code>, to enable batching capabilities, allowing for gas sponsoring, expirations, scripting, and beyond.</td><td>Fuel has scripts and predicates that, when combined, allow the execution of multiple calls in a single batch.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3102">EIP-3102: Binary Trie Structure</a></td><td>Introduces binary structure and merkelization rule for the account and storage tries, which are merged into a single “state” trie. Binary tries make for smaller (~4x) proofs than hexary tries, making it the design of choice for a stateless-friendly Ethereum.</td><td>Fuel uses a binary Sparse Merkle Trie instead of a Patricia Merkle Trie, which makes for smaller proofs and results in better performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4758">EIP-4758: Deactivate SELFDESTRUCT</a></td><td>Rename <code>SELFDESTRUCT</code> opcode to <code>SENDALL</code>, and only immediately move all ETH in the account to the target; no longer destroying code or storage or alters the nonce. Disabling <code>SELFDESTRUCT</code> will be a requirement for statelessness.</td><td>The FuelVM doesn't have a <code>SELFDESTRUCT</code> opcode which can complicate client implementations.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5027">EIP-5027: Remove the limit on contract code size</a></td><td>Remove the limit on the code size so that users can deploy a large-code contract without worrying about splitting the contract into several sub-contracts. With the dramatic growth of decentralized applications, the functionalities of smart contracts are becoming more and more complicated, and thus, the sizes of newly developed contracts are steadily increasing. As a result, we are facing more issues with the 24576-bytes contract size limit.</td><td>FuelVM doesn't have a limit on the size of a single contract below their physical limits. We have an instruction that allows you to load bytecode from another contract into the current execution context, allowing you to use it as a single contract even if you have to split bytecode across multiple transactions. It'll have a single monolithic bytecode and one state. In EVM, if you spit a contract across two transactions, it's two separate contracts, and you have to do things like delegate calls to share the state between the two contracts and can't do things like jump between bytecode on each contract.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5065">EIP-5065: Instruction for Transferring Ether</a></td><td>Add a new instruction that transfers ether to a destination address without handing over the flow of execution to it. Ethereum currently has no ideal way to transfer ether without transferring the execution flow. People have come up with reentrancy guards and similar solutions to prevent some types of attacks, but it’s not an ideal solution.</td><td>The FuelVM has <a href="https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs/blob/5dcf71f162b11fb9ce998315a7078630d78536b7/specs/vm/instruction_set.md#tr-transfer-coins-to-contract">an instruction called <code>TR</code></a>, short for transfer, which transfers a native asset to a contract but doesn't allow the receiving contract to execute logic. You might want to do this to ensure the receiving contract cannot reenter. This doesn't exist as a native, first-class instruction in the EVM- you can do this by self-destructing a contract but it's a messy workaround that only works for ETH.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-86">EIP-86: Abstraction of Transaction Origin and Signature</a> and <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2938">EIP-2938: Account Abstraction</a></td><td>Implements a set of changes that serve the combined purpose of “abstracting out” signature verification and nonce checking, allowing users to create “account contracts” that perform any desired signature/nonce checks instead of using the mechanism currently hard-coded into transaction processing.</td><td>FuelVM has stateless account abstraction, enabling application-layer logic to configure validity rules of transactions. On Ethereum today, a transaction is valid if the user has enough Ether, the nonce is correct, and signature is valid. With account abstraction, the user can change the validity of the transaction logic without a hard fork. This could mean changes to the signature scheme or natively locking an account behind a multisig.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1051">EIP-1051: Overflow Checking for the EVM</a></td><td>This EIP adds overflow checking for EVM arithmetic operations and two new opcodes that check and clear the overflow flags. Since the EVM operates on mod 2^256 integers and provides no built-in overflow detection or prevention, this requires manual checks on every arithmetic operation.</td><td>Overflow checking is built into the FuelVM and can be optionally disabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2803">EIP-2803: Rich Transactions</a></td><td>If a transaction has a to of address x, then the data of the transaction will be treated as EVM bytecode, and it will be executed from the context of the CALLER of the transaction (aka: the transaction signer). Many Ethereum DApps require users to approve multiple transactions to produce one effect. This results in a poor user experience and complicates the experience of interacting with DApps.</td><td>The FuelVM has scripts that implement this.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2926">EIP-2926: Chunk-based Code Merkelization</a></td><td>Bytecode is currently the second contributor to block witness size after the proof hashes. Transitioning the trie from hexary to binary reduces the hash section of the witness by 3x, thereby making code the first contributor. By breaking contract code into chunks and committing to those chunks in a Merkle tree, stateless clients would only need the chunks that were touched during a given transaction to execute it.</td><td>To get a code hash on Ethereum, you hash together all the byte code. The problem is that if you want to do things with statelessness or fraudproofs, to show that this hash is valid, you have to provide all the byte code, up to 24KB per contract. This EIP suggests we should merkalize it instead of hashing. The FuelVM implements this by having code roots instead of code hashes.</td></tr>

<p>Developers can get everything they need to start creating Sway applications for the Fuel VM with a single toolchain, blessed by the same teams that create the FuelVM and Sway language.</p>
<p>One common issue developers face when working within the Ethereum ecosystem is how to choose a set of tools to get started. Historically, Ethereum's founders have been particularly focused on the low-level details of the protocol, the EVM and to a lesser extent Solidity, leaving the job of creating accessible, high-level tooling to the community. As a result, many disparate projects have appeared from different 3rd parties that aim to provide these high-level solutions such as truffle, dapptools, hard hat, foundry and many more. It can be difficult for new Ethereum developers to navigate this space and to feel comfortable knowing they're making the right choice in selecting one of these toolchains.</p>
<p>In contrast, Fuel Labs take a curated, &quot;batteries-included&quot;-yet-modular approach to providing tooling. We aim to provide a comprehensive, standardized, canonical set of tools that cover not only the lower levels of the stack (like protocol and VM implementations) but the higher level too (such as package management, editor support, common-use plugins and much more). We aim to do so in a manner that is open, transparent and welcoming of external contributions.</p>
<p>To clarify, the goal is not at all to discourage 3rd parties from extending the fuel ecosystem. Rather, we aim to make the official tool-chain so good as to inspire contributions upstream and to collaborate under one unified developer ecosystem. For those cases where our tooling falls short and additions or extensions are required, we provide an extensible plugin system through <code>forc</code>, enabling community creativity in a manner that is easily-shareable and familiar to fellow Fuel devs.</p>
<p>The Sway VS Code plugin is a great example of our vision for a unified developer experience. The plugin interacts with the Sway language server, a forc plugin that communicates directly with the Sway compiler and shares much of its code-base. The plugin also allows for spinning up a Fuel node, displaying its status in real-time and (in the near future) interact with your smart contracts via the type script SDK. A complete solution from entirely within the plugin, from one team with a shared vision.</p>
<p>You can start experimenting with the Fuel toolchain by following the <a href="https://fuellabs.github.io/fuelup/master/installation/index.html#quickstart">Fuelup Quickstart Guide</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="modular-movement"><a class="header" href="#modular-movement">Modular Movement</a></h1>
<p>Although L2s have opened up a margin of cost reduction for access to the Ethereum ecosystem, the total throughput increase has been modest at best (with both optimistic and ZK approaches). And in times of high traffic on Ethereum, L2s have failed to keep costs low, often rising to several dollars per transaction.</p>
<p>As a community, if we want to achieve true global access to blockchain technology, we cannot settle for a modest reduction in fees. We need dramatic change. Change that not only reduces waste and inefficiency but opens up new use cases never before seen in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing colossal shift happening in layer-1 (L1) blockchain architectures. We are moving away from a monolithic design, where consensus, data availability, and execution are tightly coupled (e.g. today's Ethereum), to a modular future, where execution is separated from data availability and consensus (e.g. tomorrow's Eth2, or Celestia). This separation allows for specialization at the base layer, delivering a significant increase in bandwidth capacity.</p>
<h2 id="why-modular"><a class="header" href="#why-modular">Why Modular?</a></h2>
<p>A modular blockchain architecture does not inherently enable scaling. The properties that are derived as a result are what make this possible. Fuel was built for fraud proofs, enabling trust-minimized light clients, enabling high security without requiring high resource usage.</p>
<h3 id="security-vs-resource-requirements"><a class="header" href="#security-vs-resource-requirements">Security vs. Resource Requirements</a></h3>
<p><img src="./images/resource-security-1.png" alt="fuel1" /></p>
<p>In a monolithic architecture, users must choose between high security and high computational resource usage and trusted security and low computational resource usage. For example, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/run-a-node/">Ethereum was designed to allow consumer-grade hardware to be able to run a full node</a>, a type of node that offers maximum security by downloading and verifying every single transaction. By running a full node, users don’t have to trust that the chain is valid and can instead verify themselves. However, running a full node requires a lot of disk space and non-negligible CPU allocation and can take days to sync the blockchain from genesis.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a user can run a light client, also known as an honest majority light client. Instead of downloading all blocks to verify transactions, light clients only download block headers and check their proof-of-work (PoW), assuming the heaviest chain is valid. Honest majority light-clients that trust that a majority of validators are honest and will reject fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>The amount of computational resources and storage needed to run a light client is lower than a full node by several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>An easy way to remember the difference: An honest majority light client is only secure if most validators are honest. A full node is honest even if all validators are not honest.</p>
<p>By running a full node, you get the maximum security of verifying transactions but also have to spend a lot of computational resources to achieve this. Because a light client doesn’t need to run 24/7 and doesn’t interact directly with the chain, the computational requirement is much lower, but you also get low security.</p>
<h3 id="trust-minimized-light-clients"><a class="header" href="#trust-minimized-light-clients">Trust-Minimized Light Clients</a></h3>
<p><img src="./images/fuel%20light%20client.png" alt="graph showing security versus resource requirements on running full node, honest-majority light client, and trust-minimized light client" /></p>
<p>Fuel’s design lets light clients say that blocks are valid through fraud proofs. This eliminates the need for a trusted party while maintaining low resource requirements and achieving high security. For monolithic chains like Ethereum, there is an ideological incentive to keep the computation requirements for full nodes low to allow users to be truly sovereign.</p>
<p>Because Fuel was built for fraud proofs, the resource requirements for full nodes can be higher, thus increasing bandwidth capacity while still allowing users to verify the chain through trust-minimized light clients.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="monolithic-architecture"><a class="header" href="#monolithic-architecture">Monolithic Architecture</a></h1>
<p>Blockchains as we know them have four functions. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Execution: Execute transactions to make updates to the state.</li>
<li>Settlement: Dispute resolution.</li>
<li>Consensus: Defines the state and validates that all nodes on the blockchain have the same state.</li>
<li>Data availability: Ensure block data has been published to the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monolithic blockchains are a type of blockchain architecture that handle all four functions, at the same time, on this single layer.</p>
<p><img src="./images/monolithic.png" alt="monolithic" /></p>
<h2 id="challenges-with-monolithic"><a class="header" href="#challenges-with-monolithic">Challenges with Monolithic</a></h2>
<p>Some constraints and challenges with a monolithic architecture:</p>
<h3 id="costly-and-inefficient-transaction-verification"><a class="header" href="#costly-and-inefficient-transaction-verification">Costly and inefficient transaction verification</a></h3>
<p>In order to verify the validity of transactions in the chain, full nodes must download the entire chain and execute each transaction locally.</p>
<h3 id="resource-constraints"><a class="header" href="#resource-constraints">Resource constraints</a></h3>
<p>The blockchain is bound by the resource capacity of its nodes. Throughput is constrained by the resource requirements of a <em>single</em> node since the blockchain is replicated, not distributed, across nodes.</p>
<h3 id="shared-resources"><a class="header" href="#shared-resources">Shared resources</a></h3>
<p>In a monolithic architecture, the four functions of the chain operate on the same finite set of compute resources. For example, using a node's capacity for execution means that there's less capacity left over for data availability.</p>
<h3 id="scalability"><a class="header" href="#scalability">Scalability</a></h3>
<p>Scalability is defined as the ratio of throughput to decentralization. To increase throughput—the number transactions per second—you have to increase bandwidth, compute, and storage capacity, which pushes up the cost to run a full node as a user. This is not scalability, as it reduces the number of people who can run a full node to validate the chain.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="fuel-configurations"><a class="header" href="#fuel-configurations">Fuel Configurations</a></h1>
<p>Fuel is a modular architecture and is designed to operate in multiple different configurations.</p>
<p><img src="./images/configs.png" alt="image of fuel running in different configurations across consensus, settlmenent, data availability, and execution" /></p>

<h2 id="defining-rollups"><a class="header" href="#defining-rollups">Defining Rollups</a></h2>
<p>A layer-2 is a term used to describe a set of scaling solutions. A rollup is an off-chain network built on top of the layer-1 that executes transactions off-chain, bundles these transactions, and posts the bundled transactions as a single transaction on the layer-1 chain.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/">this resource to learn more about rollups and layer-2s</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fuel-as-a-rollup-or-layer-2"><a class="header" href="#fuel-as-a-rollup-or-layer-2">Fuel as a Rollup or Layer-2</a></h2>
<p>Fuel is designed to run a modular execution layer, a configuration similar to what we call rollups or layer-2s on Ethereum today. Rollups typically use an optimistic or zk-configuration for validity or transaction arbitration. The Fuel technology is agnostic to either of these and can utilize either as a validity or fraud-proving system.</p>
<p>Layer-2s and rollups are primarily designed for monolithic blockchain stacks, which means they are typically not optimized for large amounts of layer-1 bandwidth potential unlike Fuel, which is uniquely configured to handle this potential.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="fuel-configurations-2"><a class="header" href="#fuel-configurations-2">Fuel Configurations</a></h1>
<h2 id="defining-a-layer-1"><a class="header" href="#defining-a-layer-1">Defining a Layer-1</a></h2>
<p>A layer-1 is a blockchain network responsible for handling all functions of a chain including settlement, execution, data availability, and consensus. This has been colloquially named a layer-1 because rollups, or layer-2s, sit on top of these chains.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/#what-is-layer-2">this resource to learn more about layer-1s.</a></p>
<h2 id="fuel-as-a-layer-1"><a class="header" href="#fuel-as-a-layer-1">Fuel as a Layer-1</a></h2>
<p>The Fuel technology includes all the components to run as a complete layer-1 solution. These components include consensus, data availability, settlement, and transaction execution. The common configurations for running in this mode would be proof of authority and a proof of stake via a Tendermint-BFT style.</p>
<p>While Fuel can run in this configuration, we do not promote or support this outside of testing, as the broader mission of Fuel is to enhance existing blockchains such as Ethereum as a high-performance execution layer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="fuel-configurations-3"><a class="header" href="#fuel-configurations-3">Fuel Configurations</a></h1>
<h2 id="defining-state-channels"><a class="header" href="#defining-state-channels">Defining State Channels</a></h2>
<p>A state channel is a smart contract that enforces off-chain transactions between predefined parties. Each transaction updates the state of the chain and is cryptographically provable on-chain.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/state-channels/">this resource to learn more about state channels.</a></p>
<h2 id="fuel-as-a-state-channel"><a class="header" href="#fuel-as-a-state-channel">Fuel as a State Channel</a></h2>
<p>The FuelVM is a priced virtual machine architecture with a deterministic state system, which makes it perfect for multi-party channel designs where all parties must have clarity over the exact state of the system at each communication step or window.</p>
<p>While we do not ship a channel configuration of the Fuel technology out of the box, the FuelVM is perfectly situated to handle this particular use case.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="fuel-configurations-4"><a class="header" href="#fuel-configurations-4">Fuel Configurations</a></h1>
<h2 id="defining-sidechain"><a class="header" href="#defining-sidechain">Defining Sidechain</a></h2>
<p>A sidechain is a blockchain with a one-way trust-minimized bridge from the base chain.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/sidechains/">this resource to learn more about sidechains.</a></p>
<h2 id="fuel-as-a-sidechain"><a class="header" href="#fuel-as-a-sidechain">Fuel as a Sidechain</a></h2>
<p>The Fuel technology can also run as a sidechain to an existing layer-1. This means there is a message passing bridge between the layer-1 and Fuel. In this configuration, data availability would be handled by the side chain, while settlement is handled by the layer-1.</p>
<p>There would also be an option to run it in a semi-provable configuration, whereby fraud proofs can be used to ensure better validity guarantees using the layer-1 as an arbitrator.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="contract-and-call-model"><a class="header" href="#contract-and-call-model">Contract and Call Model</a></h1>
<p>Fuel uses a similar model to Ethereum for contracts and cross-contract calls. Contracts may call other contracts with a <a href="https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs/blob/master/specs/vm/instruction_set.md#call-call-contract"><code>CALL</code></a> (similar to an Ethereum <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/blob/8fea825c80e27fa9df5d89fb3365d1067788724e/Paper.tex#L1451">message call</a>). Unlike the EVM, which can only forward its base asset with a call (i.e. ETH), the FuelVM can forward a single <a href="fuelvm/./native_assets.html">native fungible asset</a> with a call.</p>
<p>Transactions may initiate contract calls. Ethereum transactions may call <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/blob/8fea825c80e27fa9df5d89fb3365d1067788724e/Paper.tex#L322">a single contract directly</a>. Fuel transactions instead execute a <a href="https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs/blob/master/specs/vm/main.md#script-execution">script</a> (arbitrary bytecode attached to the transaction), which may call any number of contracts.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="memory-model"><a class="header" href="#memory-model">Memory Model</a></h1>
<p>The EVM uses a linear memory (i.e. starting at zero and growing), without a defined limit. Allocating memory costs <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/blob/8fea825c80e27fa9df5d89fb3365d1067788724e/Paper.tex#L2114">a quadratic amount of gas</a>, which severely limits the amount of memory usable in a single context (i.e. contract call).</p>
<p>In addition, the EVM has a separate memory space per context. Contexts may communicate with each other my copying data to call data and return data buffers.</p>
<p>The FuelVM uses a single share memory block <em>per transaction</em>. Memory is allocated statically with a known upper bound, allowing for straightforward implementation of heap types such as <a href="https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/blob/master/sway-lib-std/src/vec.sw">vectors</a>. Memory in the FuelVM is globally readable across contexts, but locally writable. Each context may only write to portions of the stack and the heap which it has <a href="https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs/blob/master/specs/vm/main.md#ownership">ownership</a> over.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="multiple-native-assets"><a class="header" href="#multiple-native-assets">Multiple Native Assets</a></h1>
<p>Fuel supports multiple native assets as first-class citizens. Any single asset may be forwarded with a <a href="https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs/blob/master/specs/vm/instruction_set.md#call-call-contract"><code>CALL</code></a>. Contracts have a balance of all possible assets instead of only the base asset.</p>
<p>Note that only the base asset is usable to pay for gas fees.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sway-language-1"><a class="header" href="#sway-language-1">Sway Language</a></h1>
<p>Sway is a smart contract programming language that prioritizes safety and speed and brings modern programming language theory to the blockchain. Check out the Sway docs <a href="https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/latest/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rust--solidity--sway"><a class="header" href="#rust--solidity--sway">Rust + Solidity = Sway</a></h2>
<p>Sway prioritizes compile-time analysis and safety, similar to Rust’s borrow checker and safety-first semantics. Additionally, it has the syntax of Rust. From Solidity, Sway took the notion of a smart-contract-paradigm language with built-in top-level contract storage and blockchain mechanisms for ergonomic and safe contract programming.</p>
<p>In addition to robust documentation, tooling, clear error messages, and more – Sway brings the notion of static auditing to smart contracts. The compiler will catch things that one would typically hire an auditing firm to catch. This is particularly unique. In addition, Sway is highly performant and has extensible optimization passes and a modular backend for targeting different blockchain architectures.</p>
<p>Check out Sway examples <a href="https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/tree/master/examples">here</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sway-design-philosophy"><a class="header" href="#sway-design-philosophy">Sway Design Philosophy</a></h1>
<p>Sway follows the design philosophies of Rust and Solidity, with some Fuel ideology mixed in. From Solidity, we took the notion of smart contract programming as a paradigm. This led to storage blocks, contract ABIs as entry points, etc.</p>
<p>From Rust, we took the prioritizations of performance, control, and safety. In Rust, this means the borrow checker, safe parallelism (send and sync), annotated unsafety, etc., mainly to save the programmer from referencing freed memory, shared mutable state, and undesirable memory management. This is great for a general-purpose language model. Sway, however, is not general purpose. Sway targets a blockchain VM environment, where execution is not indefinite, and memory allocation and management are less concerned. Instead, we need to optimize for gas costs and contract-level safety. We applied the philosophy of performance, control, and safety and interpreted it in this new context. This is where Sway gets compile time checks of state mutability, namespacing of state variables, static analysis passes, and gas profiling/optimization.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sway-safety"><a class="header" href="#sway-safety">Sway Safety</a></h1>
<p>Sway provides multiple layers of safety. For one, we provide canonical tooling and &quot;one right way&quot; to do things. This results in less ambiguity and more correct/helpful tools. This tooling ships a debugger, gas profiler, testing framework, SDK, formatter, and more. These tools ensure the programmer has nothing between them and the algorithm they are trying to implement. Safety comes from the foundation of a comfortable and ergonomic environment.</p>
<p>In addition, Sway has implemented static analysis checks like a <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.11/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern"><em>Checks, Effects, Interactions</em></a> checker, state and storage purity checking, immutable-by-default semantics, and other static compile-time audits to promote safety.</p>
