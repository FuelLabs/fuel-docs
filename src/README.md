# The Fuel Book

Fuel is the fastest modular execution layer, delivering maximum security and highest flexible throughput.

## Alpha

- Follow [Fuel Labs](https://twitter.com/fuellabs_) on Twitter for all the alpha.
- Follow [Sway](https://twitter.com/SwayLang), our Rust-based DSL on Twitter for even more alpha.
- Join the [Fuel discord](https://discord.com/invite/fuelnetwork) where you can ask questions, build with others, and get even more alpha.
- [Check out this page](https://github.com/FuelLabs/awesome-fuel) to learn about upcoming events, read articles, listen to podcasts, and view presentations on Fuel.
