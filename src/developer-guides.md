# Developer Guides

If you know JavaScript, you can effectively learn how to build fullstack dapps (decentralized applications) on Fuel with Sway. Once you learn the fundamentals of Sway language, you can build and deploy your own fullstack dapps on Fuel.

The following guides are reference examples that will teach you how to write smart contracts with Sway and build your own frontend using the Fuel TypeScript SDK. Check them out!
