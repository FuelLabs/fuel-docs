# Fuel Indexer

The Fuel Indexer is a standalone binary that can be used to index various components of the blockchain. These indexable components include blocks, transactions, and receipts and state within a fuel network, allowing for high-performance read-only access to the blockchain for advanced dApp use-cases.

Events can be indexed by the Fuel Indexer by using WASM modules, [as described in the Hello World example](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-indexer/master/examples/hello-indexer.html).
