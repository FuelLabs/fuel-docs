# Rust SDK

Rust SDK for Fuel. It can be used for a variety of things, including but not limited to:

- Compiling, deploying, and testing Sway contracts;
- Launching a local Fuel network;
- Crafting and signing transactions with hand-crafted scripts or contract calls;
- Generating type-safe Rust bindings of contract methods;
And more, fuels-rs is still in active development.

Getting started with the Rust SDK:
