Check out these docs to connect your SDK to the `beta-1` testnet [here](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuels-rs/v0.22.0/providers/external-node.html).

## Deploy a Contract to the `Beta-1` Testnet

To deploy a contract to the testnet, [you'll need to create a wallet using `forc-wallet`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/forc-wallet#forc-wallet) and then run the following command:
`forc deploy --url https://node-beta-1.fuel.network/graphql --gas-price 1`

Check out the [Developer Quickstart](../developer-quickstart.md) to see a working example of how to deploy a contract to `beta-1`.

For more information on versioning, tooling, and resources, check out the [beta-1 page](../networks/beta-1.md).

## Deploy a Contract to the `Beta-2` Testnet

To deploy a contract to the testnet, [you'll need to create a wallet using `forc-wallet`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/forc-wallet#forc-wallet) and then run the following command:
