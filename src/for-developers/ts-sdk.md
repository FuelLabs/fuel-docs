# Typescript SDK

The Fuel typescript SDK is used to interact with Fuel contracts from client applications. If you're coming from Ethereum, you can think of the SDK as the equivalent of Ethers.js or WAGMI. 

To get started using the Typescript SDK:

- [SDK Docs](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuels-ts/)
- [TS Quickstart Guide](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuels-ts/QUICKSTART.html)
- [RS SDK Repo](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts)
