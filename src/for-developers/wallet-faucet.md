# Fuel Wallet

You can deploy a contract to a local fuel instance without signing with a wallet by running the following command:

`forc deploy --unsigned`

To deploy a contract to the testnet, you'll need a Fuel wallet. You can initialize a wallet and an account for your wallet to sign transactions.

[Check out the documentation](https://github.com/FuelLabs/forc-wallet#forc-wallet) for a step-by-step guide to initializing a wallet and creating an account.
