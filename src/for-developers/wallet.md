# Fuel Wallet

> Note: the wallet is an alpha version. For now, it isn't possible to download the extension directly from the Chrome Web Store.

Fuel has a wallet extension that allows users interact with apps built on the Fuel network with their own wallet. For instructions on how to download the extension and use the SDK in your app, check out the Fuel Wallet docs [here](https://wallet.fuel.network/).
