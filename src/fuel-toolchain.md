# Fuel Toolchain

- Fuel Labs developed a completely integrated developer toolchain to deliver a seamless developer experience. 
- The FuelVM was developed alongside Sway, a domain specific language based on Rust that allows developers to leverage a blockchain VM without needlessly verbose boilerplate. 
- The entire toolchain, from indexing and querying, to language, to the VM has all been created by our team and will be maintained in perpetuity, creating an ecosystem that is not fragmented, reliable, and *just works.*
