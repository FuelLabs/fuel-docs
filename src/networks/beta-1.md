# The `beta-1` testnet

The beta-1 network is the first public Fuel testnet, shared by all developers and users that interact with it. Developers may deploy contracts to it at will‚Äîno permission or whitelisting required‚Äîand users may interact with deployed contracts as well.

üö∞ Faucet - Use the faucet to get test ETH to deploy contracts with or to interact with contracts. Available here: [https://faucet-beta-1.fuel.network](https://faucet-beta-1.fuel.network).

üìÉ GraphQL endpoint - The Fuel Core node uses GraphQL instead of JSON RPC. A playground for the public GraphQL endpoint for beta-1 is available at [https://node-beta-1.fuel.network/playground](https://node-beta-1.fuel.network/playground).

üîç Block explorer - A block explorer (still heavily in development) is available at [https://fuellabs.github.io/block-explorer-v2](https://fuellabs.github.io/block-explorer-v2).

Join the [Fuel Labs Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fuelnetwork) and head to the üß™Ô∏±testnet-beta-1 channel to get support from our team.
