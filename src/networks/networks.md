# Networks

On this page, you'll find information on the different testnet networks.

## `beta-4` testnet
<!-- This example should include a description for the latest network -->
<!-- latest_network:example:start -->
The `beta-4` network is the latest Fuel testnet. It builds on the foundation of `beta-3`, enhancing public P2P access, allowing parallel predicate execution, and introducing a newly redesigned bridging approach that ensures security for full rollups.

## `beta-3` testnet

The `beta-3` network is the third Fuel testnet. It expands on the features of `beta-2`, introducing P2P networking and the ability to run synchronizing full nodes.

## `beta-2` testnet

The `beta-2` network is the second Fuel testnet, launched with a bridge to Ethereum's Goerli test network. With this network, developers are able to build and test cross-chain dapps, laying the foundations for projects building on Fuel to tap into Ethereum's massive liquidity and existing user base.

## `beta-1` testnet

The beta-1 network is the first public Fuel testnet, shared by all developers and users that interact with it. Developers may deploy contracts to it at will—no permission or whitelisting required—and users may interact with deployed contracts as well.
