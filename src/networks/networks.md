# Networks

On this page, you'll find information on the different testnet networks.

## `beta-1` testnet

The beta-1 network is the first public Fuel testnet, shared by all developers and users that interact with it. Developers may deploy contracts to it at will—no permission or whitelisting required—and users may interact with deployed contracts as well. Read more about `beta-1` [here.](./beta-1.md)

## `beta-2` testnet

The `beta-2` network is launched with a bridge to Ethereum's Goerli test network. With this network, developers are able to build and test cross-chain dapps, laying the foundations for projects building on Fuel to tap into Ethereum's massive liquidity and existing user base.
